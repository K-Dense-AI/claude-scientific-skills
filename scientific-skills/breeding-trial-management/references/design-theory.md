# Design and Selection Theory Notes

## Trial Design

- RCBD: good when field variation can be controlled by blocks
- Alpha-lattice: useful for many entries where full replication is expensive
- Augmented design: combines replicated checks with many unreplicated entries

## Selection

- Selection index combines multiple traits into one decision score
- Economic weights represent breeding priorities
- GEBV ranking should include uncertainty, not only point estimates

## Crossing

- Pairing high-value parents can improve gain
- Coancestry penalties help limit inbreeding risk
- Balanced parent usage often improves long-term genetic diversity
