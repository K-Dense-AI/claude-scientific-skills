# Graphical Abstract and TOC Graphics Guide

## Overview

Graphical abstracts and Table of Contents (TOC) graphics are visual summaries of a scientific paper, designed to convey the main finding or concept at a glance. Many journals now require or strongly encourage them. This guide covers the differences between graphical abstract and TOC graphic formats, journal-specific requirements, design principles, production workflows, and common mistakes.

## Graphical Abstract vs. TOC Graphics

### Graphical Abstract

A graphical abstract is a single visual summary displayed prominently on the article landing page and in search results. It is intended for a broad audience and should communicate the key message without requiring the reader to open the paper.

**Characteristics:**
- Larger format (often full-width or near full-width)
- May include text annotations, labels, and a brief conclusion
- Used by Elsevier, Cell Press, Wiley, and others
- Displayed on the article webpage and in graphical abstract galleries
- Often the first visual a reader encounters online

### TOC (Table of Contents) Graphics

A TOC graphic is a smaller, more compact image used in journal table of contents pages and article listings. It is typically seen alongside the title and author list.

**Characteristics:**
- Smaller and more constrained in size
- Minimal or no text (the title provides context)
- Used primarily by ACS journals
- Must communicate the core idea with minimal visual elements
- Functions like a "thumbnail" for the paper

### Key Differences

| Feature | Graphical Abstract | TOC Graphic |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Size | Larger (varies by journal) | Smaller (typically 3.25 x 1.75 in) |
| Text allowed | Yes, brief annotations | Minimal to none |
| Audience | General scientific reader | Specialist browsing journal contents |
| Display context | Article landing page, search | Table of contents listing |
| Detail level | Moderate | Low (must be readable at small size) |
| Primary journals | Elsevier, Cell, Wiley | ACS |

## Journal-Specific Requirements

## Design Principles

### 1. One Clear Message

A graphical abstract should convey exactly one take-home message. If a reader cannot understand the main point within 10 seconds, the design needs simplification.

**Guidelines:**
- Identify the single most important result or concept
- Build the entire visual around that message
- Remove anything that does not directly support the message
- The viewer's eye should flow from input/problem (left) to output/result (right)

### 2. Visual Flow and Composition

**Left-to-right narrative:** Western readers naturally scan left to right. Structure the graphical abstract as a visual story:

```
[Starting material / Problem / Input]
    --> [Process / Method / Mechanism]
        --> [Product / Result / Outcome]
```

**Layout patterns:**

- **Linear flow:** A --> B --> C (most common, best for synthetic or process papers)
- **Comparison:** A vs. B side by side (best for "before/after" or "old vs. new")
- **Central hub:** Core concept in center with radiating elements (best for multifunctional materials or platform technologies)
- **Top-to-bottom cascade:** Steps flowing downward (best for multi-step processes)

### 3. Essential Components

A well-designed graphical abstract typically includes 3-5 of these elements:

1. **Chemical structures or molecular representations** (for chemistry papers)
2. **Key data visualization** (a simplified plot, not a full figure)
3. **Schematic diagrams** (process flow, device architecture)
4. **Arrows or connectors** showing relationships or transformations
5. **Brief text labels** (1-3 words per label, not sentences)
6. **Icons or simplified illustrations** (cells, organisms, equipment)

### 4. Color Strategy

**Use a limited, intentional palette:**
- 2-3 main colors maximum for the core message
- Use color to direct attention to the key result
- Maintain contrast against white background
- Ensure accessibility (no red-green combinations)

**Recommended approach:**
```
- Background: White
- Primary accent: One bold color for the key finding (e.g., #0072B2)
- Secondary accent: One complementary color (e.g., #E69F00)
- Neutral elements: Gray tones for supporting structures
- Text: Black or dark gray
```

### 5. Typography in Graphical Abstracts

- **Font:** Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica) for consistency with figures
- **Size:** Minimum 10-12 pt at final display size
- **Amount:** As little text as possible; prefer visual elements
- **Style:** Bold for emphasis; avoid italics within the graphic (except standard conventions like genus names)
- **No full sentences:** Use 1-3 word labels only

### 6. Simplification

Scientific graphical abstracts often fail by including too much detail. Apply aggressive simplification:

- **Chemical structures:** Show only the key functional groups or pharmacophore, not the full synthesis
- **Data plots:** Simplify to a schematic trend (arrow going up) rather than actual data with error bars
- **Mechanisms:** Show 2-3 key steps, not every intermediate
- **Devices:** Show a simplified cross-section, not a photograph

## Production Workflow

### Approach 1: Matplotlib + Vector Editor (Recommended)

This two-stage workflow uses matplotlib for data-driven components and a vector editor (Inkscape or Illustrator) for assembly and polish.

**Stage 1: Create components in Python**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import numpy as np

def create_graphical_abstract_component(data_x, data_y,
                                          xlabel, ylabel,
                                          color='#0072B2',
                                          figsize=(2, 1.5)):
    """
    Create a simplified plot component for a graphical abstract.
    Export as SVG for assembly in a vector editor.
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)

    ax.plot(data_x, data_y, color=color, linewidth=2)
    ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=9, fontweight='bold')
    ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=9, fontweight='bold')

    # Minimal styling for graphical abstract
    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
    ax.tick_params(labelsize=7)

    fig.tight_layout()
    fig.savefig('ga_component_plot.svg', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')
    fig.savefig('ga_component_plot.pdf', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')
    return fig


def create_arrow_block(text_left, text_right, arrow_label='',
                        figsize=(4, 1)):
    """
    Create a simple input --> output arrow diagram component.
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)
    ax.set_xlim(0, 10)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 2)
    ax.axis('off')

    # Left box
    left_box = mpatches.FancyBboxPatch(
        (0.5, 0.3), 2.5, 1.2, boxstyle='round,pad=0.1',
        facecolor='#56B4E9', edgecolor='black', linewidth=1)
    ax.add_patch(left_box)
    ax.text(1.75, 0.9, text_left, ha='center', va='center',
            fontsize=9, fontweight='bold')

    # Arrow
    ax.annotate('', xy=(6.5, 0.9), xytext=(3.5, 0.9),
                arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', lw=2, color='black'))
    if arrow_label:
        ax.text(5.0, 1.3, arrow_label, ha='center', va='center',
                fontsize=8, style='italic')

    # Right box
    right_box = mpatches.FancyBboxPatch(
        (6.8, 0.3), 2.5, 1.2, boxstyle='round,pad=0.1',
        facecolor='#E69F00', edgecolor='black', linewidth=1)
    ax.add_patch(right_box)
    ax.text(8.05, 0.9, text_right, ha='center', va='center',
            fontsize=9, fontweight='bold')

    fig.tight_layout()
    fig.savefig('ga_component_arrow.svg', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')
    return fig
```

**Stage 2: Assemble in a vector editor**

1. Open a new document at the required dimensions (e.g., 3.25 x 1.75 in for ACS TOC)
2. Import SVG/PDF components from Stage 1
3. Add chemical structures (drawn in ChemDraw, exported as SVG/EPS)
4. Add icons or schematic elements
5. Arrange following left-to-right visual flow
6. Ensure all text is at minimum 10 pt
7. Export as TIFF (300-600 DPI) or PDF

### Approach 2: Pure Matplotlib

For simpler graphical abstracts, everything can be done in matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetImage, AnnotationBbox
import numpy as np

def create_graphical_abstract_acs(filename='graphical_abstract',
                                    dpi=600):
    """
    Create an ACS-format TOC graphic (3.25 x 1.75 inches).
    """
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(3.25, 1.75))
    fig.patch.set_facecolor('white')

    # Use gridspec for flexible layout
    gs = fig.add_gridspec(1, 3, wspace=0.1,
                          left=0.02, right=0.98,
                          top=0.92, bottom=0.08)

    # --- Left panel: Input/Starting point ---
    ax_left = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])
    ax_left.axis('off')

    # Draw a simple beaker/flask icon using patches
    flask = mpatches.FancyBboxPatch(
        (0.2, 0.1), 0.6, 0.6, boxstyle='round,pad=0.05',
        facecolor='#56B4E9', edgecolor='black', linewidth=0.8,
        alpha=0.7)
    ax_left.add_patch(flask)
    ax_left.text(0.5, 0.4, 'Substrate', ha='center', va='center',
                 fontsize=7, fontweight='bold')
    ax_left.set_xlim(0, 1)
    ax_left.set_ylim(0, 1)

    # --- Middle panel: Process/Arrow ---
    ax_mid = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 1])
    ax_mid.axis('off')
    ax_mid.set_xlim(0, 1)
    ax_mid.set_ylim(0, 1)

    # Large arrow
    ax_mid.annotate('', xy=(0.9, 0.45), xytext=(0.1, 0.45),
                    arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', lw=2.5,
                                    color='#009E73'))
    ax_mid.text(0.5, 0.7, 'Catalyst', ha='center', va='center',
                fontsize=7, fontweight='bold', color='#009E73')
    ax_mid.text(0.5, 0.2, '95% yield', ha='center', va='center',
                fontsize=7, fontstyle='italic', color='gray')

    # --- Right panel: Output/Result ---
    ax_right = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 2])
    ax_right.axis('off')

    product = mpatches.FancyBboxPatch(
        (0.2, 0.1), 0.6, 0.6, boxstyle='round,pad=0.05',
        facecolor='#E69F00', edgecolor='black', linewidth=0.8,
        alpha=0.7)
    ax_right.add_patch(product)
    ax_right.text(0.5, 0.4, 'Product', ha='center', va='center',
                  fontsize=7, fontweight='bold')
    ax_right.set_xlim(0, 1)
    ax_right.set_ylim(0, 1)

    # Save at high resolution
    fig.savefig(f'{filename}.tiff', dpi=dpi, bbox_inches='tight',
                facecolor='white', pil_kwargs={'compression': 'tiff_lzw'})
    fig.savefig(f'{filename}.pdf', bbox_inches='tight', facecolor='white')
    fig.savefig(f'{filename}.png', dpi=dpi, bbox_inches='tight',
                facecolor='white')

    return fig
```

### Approach 3: ChemDraw + Vector Editor (Chemistry Papers)

For papers where chemical structures are central:

1. Draw structures in ChemDraw with consistent bond lengths and atom label sizes
2. Export each structure as EPS or SVG
3. Assemble in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator
4. Add arrows, labels, and data components
5. Export at required dimensions and resolution

### Approach 4: PowerPoint (Quick Drafts Only)

PowerPoint can be used for rapid prototyping but should not be the final production tool:

1. Set slide dimensions to match journal requirements
2. Use shapes, arrows, and imported images to compose the layout
3. **Always export as high-resolution image** (File > Save As > TIFF/PNG, 300+ DPI)
4. Never submit the PowerPoint file itself

## Example Structures for Common Paper Types

### Synthesis / Catalysis Paper

```
[Reactant]  --catalyst-->  [Product]
   (structure)    (conditions)    (structure)
                                  + key metric
                                  (yield, ee, TON)
```

### Materials / Device Paper

```
[Material schematic]  -->  [Property measurement]  -->  [Application]
  (cross-section)          (simplified plot)            (icon/photo)
```

### Biological / Biomedical Paper

```
[Target/Disease]  -->  [Intervention]  -->  [Outcome]
  (cell/organ icon)     (drug/therapy)      (improved metric)
```

### Computational / Modeling Paper

```
[Input data]  -->  [Model/Algorithm]  -->  [Prediction/Insight]
  (schematic)      (workflow diagram)      (key result plot)
```

### Analytical Method Paper

```
[Sample]  -->  [Method/Instrument]  -->  [Detection/Measurement]
  (icon)       (schematic)               (spectrum/chromatogram)
```

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### 1. Too Much Information

**Problem:** Cramming an entire paper's worth of data, structures, and text into a single small image. The result is unreadable at display size.

**Solution:** Ruthlessly simplify. Show only the single most important finding. If you cannot explain it in 3-5 visual elements, the design is too complex.

### 2. Using Full-Detail Figures from the Paper

**Problem:** Shrinking a multi-panel figure with full axis labels, error bars, and legends into the graphical abstract. Text becomes illegible; details are lost.

**Solution:** Redraw a simplified schematic version of the key result. An upward-trending arrow or a simple before/after comparison communicates more effectively than a miniaturized data plot.

### 3. Wrong Dimensions

**Problem:** Creating the graphic at arbitrary dimensions and then resizing, causing stretching, distortion, or cropping by the publisher's automated system.

**Solution:** Set the exact required dimensions in your design tool before starting. Check final output matches the specification.

```python
# ACS TOC: exactly 3.25 x 1.75 inches
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(3.25, 1.75))

# Elsevier: minimum 531 x 1328 pixels
# At 300 DPI: 1.77 x 4.43 inches minimum
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4.43, 1.77))  # width x height
```

### 4. Low Contrast and Readability

**Problem:** Pastel colors, thin lines, or small text that become invisible when the graphic is displayed at reduced size on a journal webpage.

**Solution:** Use high-contrast colors. Test readability by viewing the graphic at 50% of its design size. If any element is unreadable, increase its size or contrast.

### 5. Photograph-Heavy Design

**Problem:** Using photographs (lab photos, SEM images) as the primary content. Photographs do not simplify well, are hard to interpret at small sizes, and often look cluttered.

**Solution:** Use photographs sparingly. A clean schematic illustration communicates the concept better than a photograph in most cases. If a microscopy image is essential, use only the most striking example and add clear annotations.

### 6. Copyright Violations

**Problem:** Reusing figures, icons, or images from other publications without permission. Even your own published figures may be owned by the publisher.

**Solution:**
- Create all elements from scratch
- Use open-license icon libraries (e.g., BioRender with proper licensing, Servier Medical Art under CC-BY)
- If reusing your own published figure, check the publisher's reuse policy
- For Creative Commons images, include proper attribution

### 7. Raster Text

**Problem:** Text rendered as part of a raster image (TIFF/PNG) rather than as editable vector text. Raster text looks blurry when scaled and cannot be corrected by the publisher.

**Solution:** Keep text as vector elements. If exporting from matplotlib, save as PDF or SVG first, then convert to TIFF at the required resolution only as the final step.

### 8. No Visual Hierarchy

**Problem:** All elements are the same size and weight, giving the viewer no indication of what is most important. The eye wanders without landing on the key message.

**Solution:** Make the key result the largest or most colorful element. Use size, color saturation, and position (center or right side for the "conclusion") to guide the viewer's eye.
