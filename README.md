## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this free to use?**  
A: Yes! This project is MIT licensed, allowing free use for any purpose including commercial projects.

**Q: Why are all skills grouped into one plugin instead of separate plugins?**  
A: We believe good science in the age of AI is inherently interdisciplinary. Bundling all skills into a single plugin makes it trivial for you (and Claude) to bridge across fields—e.g., combining genomics, cheminformatics, clinical data, and machine learning in one workflow—without worrying about which individual skills to install or wire together.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**  
A: Absolutely! The MIT License allows both commercial and noncommercial use without restrictions.

**Q: How often is this updated?**  
A: We regularly update skills to reflect the latest versions of packages and APIs. Major updates are announced in release notes.

**Q: Can I use this with other AI models?**  
A: The skills are optimized for Claude but can be adapted for other models with MCP support. The MCP server works with any MCP-compatible client.

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Do I need all the Python packages installed?**  
A: No! Only install the packages you need. Each skill specifies its requirements in its `SKILL.md` file.

**Q: What if a skill doesn't work?**  
A: First check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. If the issue persists, file an issue on GitHub with detailed reproduction steps.

**Q: Do the skills work offline?**  
A: Database skills require internet access to query APIs. Package skills work offline once Python dependencies are installed.

### Contributing

**Q: Can I contribute my own skills?**  
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines and best practices.

**Q: How do I report bugs or suggest features?**  
A: Open an issue on GitHub with a clear description. For bugs, include reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
