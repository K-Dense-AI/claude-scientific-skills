AB  - Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in elderly patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study aimed to identify risk factors for POD in this population. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 450 patients aged ≥65 years undergoing primary THA. POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Results: POD occurred in 68 patients (15.1%). Multivariate analysis identified advanced age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.14), preoperative cognitive impairment (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8-5.7), and surgery duration >120 minutes (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5) as independent risk factors. Conclusions: Advanced age, cognitive impairment, and prolonged surgery are significant risk factors for POD after THA in elderly patients.

AB  - Objective: To develop a risk prediction model for postoperative delirium (POD) in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 623 patients ≥65 years who underwent primary TKA. POD was diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria. Results: POD incidence was 12.4% (77/623). Independent predictors included age ≥75 years (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.6), ASA score ≥3 (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.2), preoperative benzodiazepine use (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.8-6.9), and general anesthesia (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3). Conclusion: Several preoperative factors can help identify high-risk patients for POD prevention strategies.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the association between preoperative anticholinergic medication use and postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients undergoing hip replacement. Methods: Case-control study nested within a cohort of 312 patients ≥70 years. POD was assessed using CAM-ICU. Anticholinergic burden was quantified using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale. Results: High anticholinergic burden (score ≥3) was associated with increased POD risk (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1-8.4). Each unit increase in anticholinergic burden increased POD risk by 38% (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.15-1.66). Conclusion: Minimizing anticholinergic medications preoperatively may reduce POD risk.
